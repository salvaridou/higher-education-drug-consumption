# 🎓 Higher Education and Drug Consumption  
**Is There a Link Between the Two? Exploring Trends Over the Years**

## 🧠 Abstract

During recent years, we have observed a significant shift toward postsecondary education, as completing schooling up to age 16 has become compulsory in many countries and a basic requirement for most professional careers. In parallel, educational attainment levels have increased markedly — for instance, in the United States, the proportion of college graduates rose from around 16% in the 1980s to over 37% by 2022.

This increase in qualifications has been driven by globalization and technological advancement, reshaping labor market demands in favor of individuals with broader knowledge bases and more specialized skills. While this transformation has enhanced economic opportunities and well-being, it has also coincided with a worrying trend: a substantial rise in both legal and illegal drug consumption.

Since 2000, the U.S. has recorded nearly one million drug overdose deaths. Legal drug usage — including prescription medications aimed at improving health — has also surged. This project investigates whether there is a statistical relationship between the number of years spent in education and drug consumption patterns, using real-world data and exploratory analysis.

While we initially assumed that education would promote healthier living through economic stability, we also considered that academic pressure might lead to increased drug usage. Our findings partially support the latter hypothesis: higher levels of education are associated with increased consumption of both legal and illegal drugs.
